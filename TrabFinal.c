        bool decs : boolean variable used by the user to decide if he wants to look and show a product by its name or register(position)
        char product_name[25] : The name of the product (assigned by the user on the register_product() function)
        char searchname[25] : A string with the same size of product_name. Receives a name from the user's keyboard and checks if there is a product with that same name on the memory.
        char buffer[15] : Small char buffer used to load the data from the Product Number.txt file.
        float providerprice : The price of each of that product bought from the provider (assigned on the register_product() function)
        float sellingprice : The price of each of that product sold to the consumers (assigned on the register_product() function)
        float sell1 : The value deducted from the amount of products sold and their respective unitary selling prices to the consumer
        float buy1 : The value deducted from the amount of products bought and their respective unitary buying prices stipulated by the provider
        float profit : Represents the result of the calculations done on the report_productstats() function [profit = sell1 - buy1]
        unsigned int quantity : The quantity of the product that the establishment bought (assigned by the user on the register_product() function)
        unsigned int product_code : The product's code (assigned automatically on the register_product() function)
        unsigned int regcheck : Used to check all the positions of the products struct and their respective data.
        unsigned int ps : Indicates the starting position to search for a certain product, moving up until the last position
        unsigned int pos : Consists of showing the products names for all positions, and then is used to show a more in-depth info about the product in the position that the user specified.
        unsigned int buy : Keeps track of the number of products that have been bought from the provider
        unsigned int sell : Keeps track of the number of products that have been sold to the customers
        unsigned int cont : The product number counter, which is saved into its own file to be load on posterior runs in order to load the products correctly between program executions.
        unsigned int i : A standard variable regularly used on "for" loops.
        unsigned int quant : Holds the quantity of products the user wants to register
        unsigned short int dec : Variable used by the user to decide which function to call in the main menu.
